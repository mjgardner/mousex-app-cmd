	use Mouse;

    extends qw(MouseX::App::Cmd);


    package YourApp::Cmd::Command::blort;
    use Mouse;

    extends qw(MouseX::App::Cmd::Command);

    has blortex => (
        traits => [qw(Getopt)],
        isa => "Bool",
        is  => "rw",
        cmd_aliases   => "X",
        documentation => "use the blortext algorithm",
    );

    has recheck => (
        traits => [qw(Getopt)],
        isa => "Bool",
        is  => "rw",
        cmd_aliases => "r",
        documentation => "recheck all results",
    );

    sub execute {
        my ( $self, $opt, $args ) = @_;

        # you may ignore $opt, it's in the attributes anyway

        my $result = $self->blortex ? blortex() : blort();

        print $result;
    }

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module marries L<App::Cmd|App::Cmd> with
L<MouseX::Getopt|MouseX::Getopt>.
It is a direct port of L<MooseX::App::Cmd|MooseX::App::Cmd> to L<Mouse|Mouse>.

Use it like L<App::Cmd|App::Cmd> advises (especially see
L<App::Cmd::Tutorial|App::Cmd::Tutorial>),
swapping L<App::Cmd::Command|App::Cmd::Command> for
L<MouseX::App::Cmd::Command|MouseX::App::Cmd::Command>.

Then you can write your Mouse commands as Mouse classes, with
L<MouseX::Getopt|MouseX::Getopt>
defining the options for you instead of C<opt_spec> returning a
L<Getopt::Long::Descriptive|Getopt::Long::Descriptive> spec.
