SYNOPSIS
        package YourApp::Cmd;
            use Mouse;

        extends qw(MouseX::App::Cmd);


        package YourApp::Cmd::Command::blort;
        use Mouse;

        extends qw(MouseX::App::Cmd::Command);

        has blortex => (
            traits => [qw(Getopt)],
            isa => "Bool",
            is  => "rw",
            cmd_aliases   => "X",
            documentation => "use the blortext algorithm",
        );

        has recheck => (
            traits => [qw(Getopt)],
            isa => "Bool",
            is  => "rw",
            cmd_aliases => "r",
            documentation => "recheck all results",
        );

        sub execute {
            my ( $self, $opt, $args ) = @_;

            # you may ignore $opt, it's in the attributes anyway

            my $result = $self->blortex ? blortex() : blort();

            recheck($result) if $self->recheck;

            print $result;
        }

DESCRIPTION
    This module marries App::Cmd with MouseX::Getopt. It is a direct port of
    MooseX::App::Cmd to Mouse.

    Use it like App::Cmd advises (especially see App::Cmd::Tutorial),
    swapping App::Cmd::Command for MouseX::App::Cmd::Command.

    Then you can write your Mouse commands as Mouse classes, with
    MouseX::Getopt defining the options for you instead of "opt_spec"
    returning a Getopt::Long::Descriptive spec.
